No matter how much mortals combine their power, it will be nothing more than child's play compared to the power of the gods! To think you can touch a god proves that you are stained with sin! Once again mortals imitate the gods, as they always do... And why is that? Because the gods are great? Because the gods are too beautiful? But is it sad? Are mortals to be pitied? An act committed by the gods is virtuous, but the same act committed by a mortal is evil...and thus becomes a sin! Listen well Saiyan... Goku... Although you are a mortal, you have attained the power of the gods... I suppose I should commend your perseverance in the face of your annihilation... I shall defeat you, eradicate humanity, and bring about the dawn of an endless age that can never be tainted. You are a monument to the failure of the gods who created this universe! There is no longer a need for Supreme Kais or Gods of Destruction! I, Zamasu, will purify this world. Behold the power of the gods! Behold! A body with limitless power and immortality! Indeed, by becoming one with Goku, I have taken the sins of humanity and the failure of the gods into myself! The time has come to open the earth and wash everything away... Rejoice, for the world of the gods is at hand! This tainted world is about to come to an end... A foolish lifeform doomed to see its very own mistakes. So, where will you go for aid now? The past? The future?")
